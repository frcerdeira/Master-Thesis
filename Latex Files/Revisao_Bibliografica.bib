  abstract = {We propose a physical model for the nonlinear inelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks with potential applications to inelastic cell mechanics. It consists of a minimal extension of the glassy wormlike chain (Gwlc) model, which has recently been highly successful as a quantitative mathematical description of the viscoelastic properties of biopolymer networks and cells. To extend its scope to nonequilibrium situations, where the thermodynamic state variables may evolve dynamically, the Gwlc is furnished with an explicit representation of the kinetics of breaking and reforming sticky bonds. In spite of its simplicity, the model exhibits many experimentally established nontrivial features such as power-law rheology, stress stiffening, ﬂuidization and cyclic softening effects.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental investigations have revealed a non-Maxwellian absorption pattern in the rheological spectra of actin gels, which was interpreted in terms of transient bonds. Here we examine the consequences of reversible crosslinking on the apparent linear spectra of biopolymer solutions theoretically. For a schematic model consisting of a reversibly crosslinked power-law ﬂuid we obtain a simple analytical prediction for the position of the absorption peak, which is backed up by a numerical evaluation of the inelastic glassy wormlike chain model. This establishes bond breaking as a nonlinear non-equilibrium eﬀect that can already be signiﬁcant for very small driving amplitudes. Our results may be useful for inferring binding aﬃnities and reaction rates of biochemical crosslinkers from rheological measurements of in-vitro reconstituted cytoskeletal gels.},

It is obtained from the common WLC by an exponential stretching of the relaxation spectrum of its long-wavelength eigenmodes, controlled by a single parameter E. Predictions for pertinent observables such as the dynamic structure factor and the microrheological susceptibility exhibit the characteristics of soft glassy rheology and compare favourably with experimental data for reconstituted cytoskeletal networks and live cells. We speculate about the possible microscopic origin of the stretching, implications for the nonlinear rheology, and the potential physiological signiﬁcance of our results.},

Cates, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2020 (1997)]. The model attributes similarities in the rheology of such ``soft glassy materials'' to the shared features of structural disorder and metastability. By focusing on the dynamics of mesoscopic elements, it retains a generic character. Interactions are represented by a mean-field noise temperature x, with a glass transition occurring at x=1 (in appropriate units). The exact solution of the model takes the form of a constitutive equation relating stress to strain history, from which all rheological properties can be derived. For the linear response, we find that both the storage modulus G' and the loss modulus G'' vary with frequency as \textbackslash{}omega\^\{x-1\} for 1{$<$}x{$<$}2, becoming flat near the glass transition. In the glass phase, aging of the moduli is predicted. The steady shear flow curves show power law fluid behavior for x{$<$}2, with a nonzero yield stress in the glass phase; the Cox-Merz rule does not hold in this non-Newtonian regime. Single and double step strains further probe the nonlinear behavior of the model, which is not well represented by the BKZ relation. Finally, we consider measurements of G' and G'' at finite strain amplitude \textbackslash{}gamma. Near the glass transition, G'' exhibits a maximum as \textbackslash{}gamma is increased in a strain sweep. Its value can be strongly overestimated due to nonlinear effects, which can be present even when the stress response is very nearly harmonic. The largest strain \textbackslash{}gamma\_c at which measurements still probe the linear response is predicted to be roughly frequency-independent.},

The entire illustration program has been greatly enhanced. Protein structures better illustrate structure-function relationships, icons are simpler and more consistent within and between chapters, and micrographs have been refreshed and updated with newer, clearer, or better images. As a new feature, each chapter now contains intriguing open-ended questions highlighting "What We Don't Know," introducing students to challenging areas of future research. Updated end-of-chapter problems reflect new research discussed in the text. Thought-provoking end-of-chapter questions have been expanded to all chapters, including questions on developmental biology, tissues and stem cells, the immune system, and pathogens"--},

Semiflexible biopolymers stiffen nonlinearly in response to mechanical loads, whereas the crosslinker dynamics allow for stress relaxation over time. Here we show, through rheology and theoretical modeling, that the combined nonlinearity in time and stress leads to an unexpectedly slow stress relaxation, similar to the dynamics of disordered systems close to the glass transition. Our work suggests that transient crosslinking combined with internal stress is the microscopic origin for the universal glassy dynamics as frequently observed in cellular mechanics.},

  abstract = {Current modeling of endothelial cell mechanics does not account for the network of F-actin that permeates the cytoplasm. This network, the distributed cytoplasmic structural actin (DCSA), extends from apical to basal membranes, with frequent attachments. Stress fibers are intercalated within the network, with similar frequent attachments. The microscopic structure of the DCSA resembles a foam, so that the mechanical properties can be estimated with analogy to these well-studied systems. The moduli of shear and elastic deformations are estimated to be on the order of 1 05 dynes/cm2. This prediction agrees with experimental measurements of the properties of cytoplasm and endothelial cells reported elsewhere. Stress fibers can potentially increase the modulus by a factor of 2-10, depending on whether they act in series or parallel to the network in transmitting surface forces. The deformations produced by physiological flow fields are of insufficient magnitude to disrupt cell-to-cell or DCSA cross-linkages. The questions raised by this paradox, and the ramifications of implicating the previously unreported DCSA as the primary force transmission element are discussed.},

  abstract = {Most plant and animal cells possess a complex structure of ﬁlamentous proteins and associated proteins and enzymes for bundling, cross-linking, and active force generation. This cytoskeleton is largely responsible for cell elasticity and mechanical stability. It can also play a key role in cell locomotion. Over the last few years, the single-molecule micromechanics of many of the important constituents of the cytoskeleton have been studied in great detail by biophysical techniques such as high-resolution microscopy, scanning force microscopy, and optical tweezers. At the same time, numerous in vitro experiments aimed at understanding some of the unique mechanical and dynamic properties of solutions and networks of cytoskeletal ﬁlaments have been performed. In parallel with these experiments, theoretical models have emerged that have both served to explain many of the essential material properties of these networks, as well as to motivate quantitative experiments to determine, for example concentration dependence of shear moduli and the effects of cross-links. This chapter is devoted to theoretical models of the cytoskeleton based on polymer physics at both the level of single protein ﬁlaments and the level of solutions and networks of cross-linked or entangled ﬁlaments. We begin with a derivation of the static and dynamic properties of single cytoskeletal ﬁlaments. We then proceed to build up models of solutions and cross-linked gels of cytoskeletal ﬁlaments and we discuss the comparison of these models with a variety of experiments on in vitro model systems.},

  abstract = {The cytoskeleton is generally visualized by light or electron microscopy as a meshwork of protein filaments that spans the space between the nuclear envelope and the plasma membrane. In most cell types, this meshwork is formed by a three dimensional composite network of actin filaments, microtubules (MT), and intermediate filaments (IF) together with the host of proteins that bind to the sides or ends of these linear polymers. Cytoskeletal binding proteins regulate filament length, crosslink filaments to each other, and apply forces to the filaments. One approach to modeling the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton and of cell in general is to consider the elements of the cytoskeleton as polymers, using experimental methods and theoretical models developed for traditional polymers but modified for the much larger, stiffer, and fragile biopolymers comprising the cytoskeleton. The presence of motor proteins that move actin filaments and microtubules also creates a new class of active materials that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and unconstrained by limitations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. These active materials create rich opportunities for experimental design and theoretical developments. The degree to which the mechanics of live cells can usefully be modeled as highly complex polymer networks is by no means certain, and this article will discuss recent progress in quantitatively measuring cytoskeletal polymer systems and relating them to the properties of the cell.},

Attention is now focused on how cytoskeletal networks generate, transmit and respond to mechanical signals over both short and long timescales.

  abstract = {To evaluate the contributions of cross-linker dynamics and polymer deformation to the frequency-dependent stiffness of actin filament gels, we compared the rheological properties of actin gels with three types of cross-linkers: a weak one, Acanthamoeba a-actinin (dissociation rate constant 5.2 s-1, association rate constant 1.1 x 1 06 M-1 s-1); a strong one, chicken smooth muscle a-actinin (dissociation rate constant 0.66 s-1, association rate constant 1.20 x 106 M-1 s-1); and an extremely strong one, biotin/avidin (dissociation rate constant approximately zero). The biotin/avidin cross-linked gel, whose behavior is determined by polymer bending alone, behaves like a solid and shows no frequency dependence. The amoeba a-actinin cross-linked gel behaves like a viscoelastic fluid, and the frequency dependence of the stiffness can be explained by a mathematical model for dynamically cross-linked gels. The stiffness of the chicken a-actinin cross-linked gel is independent of frequency, and has viscoelastic properties intermediate between the two. The two a-actinins have similar association rate constants for binding to actin filaments, consistent with a diffusion-limited reaction. Rigid cross-links make the gel stiff, but make it elastic without the ability to deform permanently. Dynamically cross-linked actin filaments should allow the cell to react passively to various outside forces without any sort of signaling. Slower, signal-mediated pathways, such as severing filaments or changing the affinity of cross-linkers, could alter the nature of these passive reactions.},

  abstract = {The functions and elasticities of the cell are largely related to the structures of the cytoskeletons underlying the lipid bi-layer. Among various cell types, the Red Blood Cell (RBC) possesses a relatively simple cytoskeletal structure. Underneath the membrane, the RBC cytoskeleton takes the form of a two dimensional triangular network, consisting of nodes of actins (and other proteins) and edges of spectrins. Recent experiments focusing on the malaria infected RBCs (iRBCs) showed that there is a correlation between the elongation of spectrins in the cytoskeletal network and the stiffening of the iRBCs. Here we rationalize the correlation between these two observations by combining the worm-like chain (WLC) model for single spectrins and the Effective Medium Theory (EMT) for the network elasticity. We specifically focus on how the disorders in the cytoskeletal network affect its macroscopic elasticity. Analytical and numerical solutions from our model reveal that the stiffness of the membrane increases with increasing end-to-end distances of spectrins, but has a non-monotonic dependence on the variance of the end-to-end distance distributions. These predictions are verified quantitively by our AFM and micropipette aspiration measurements of iRBCs. The model may, from a molecular level, provide guidelines for future identification of new treatment methods for RBC related diseases, such as malaria infection.},

Providing material in each chapter that builds on the previous chapters, it effectively integrates length scales and contains, for each length scale, key experimental observations and corresponding quantitative theoretical models.   Summarizes the Three Hierarchical Levels of Cell Mechanics  The book contains 14 chapters and is organized into three sections. The first section focuses on the molecular level, the second section details mechanics at the cellular level, and the third section explores cellular mechanics at the tissue level. The authors offer a thorough description of the roles of mechanical forces in cell and tissue biology, and include specific examples. They incorporate descriptions of associated theoretical models, and provide the data and modeling framework needed for a multi-scale analysis. In addition, they highlight the pioneering studies in cell–matrix mechanics by Albert K. Harris. The topics covered include:    The passive and active mechanical properties of cytoskeletal polymers and associated motor proteins along with the behavior of polymer networks The mechanical properties of the cell membrane, with an emphasis on membrane protein activation caused by membrane forces The hierarchical organization of collagen fibrils, revealing that a delicate balance exists between specific and nonspecific interactions to result in a structure with semicrystalline order as well as loose associations The roles of matrix mechanical properties on cell adhesion and function along with different mechanical mechanisms of cell–cell interactions The effects of mechanical loading on cell cytoskeletal remodeling, summarizing various modeling approaches that explain possible mechanisms regulating the alignment of actin stress fibers in response to stretching The mechanical testing of cell-populated collagen matrices, along with theory relating the passive and active mechanical properties of the engineered tissues Cell migration behavior in 3-D matrices and in collective cell motility The role of mechanics in cartilage development The roles of both cellular and external forces on tissue morphogenesis The roles of mechanical forces on tumor growth and cancer metastasis  Cell and Matrix Mechanics succinctly and systematically explains the roles of mechanical forces in cell–matrix biology.

The microstructure of the resulting networks mainly determines their mechanical properties. It remains an important challenge to relate structural transitions to both the molecular properties of the cross-linking molecules and the mechanical response of the network. This can be achieved best by well deﬁned in vitro model systems in combination with microscopic techniques. Here, we show that with increasing concentrations of the cross-linker heavy meromyosin, a transition in the mechanical network response occurs. At low cross-linker densities the network elasticity is dominated by the entanglement length le of the polymer, whereas at high heavy meromyosin densities the cross-linker distance lc determines the elastic behavior. Using microrheology the formation of heterogeneous networks is observed at low cross-linker concentrations. Micro- and macrorheology both report the same transition to a homogeneous crosslinked phase. This transition is set by a constant average cross-linker distance lc \% 15 mm. Thus, the micro- and macromechanical properties of isotropically cross-linked in vitro actin networks are determined by only one intrinsic network parameter.},

  abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton is an active gel which constantly remodels during cellular processes such as motility and division. Myosin II molecular motors are involved in this active remodeling process and therefore control the dynamic self-organization of cytoskeletal structures. Due to the complexity of in vivo systems, it is hard to investigate the role of myosin II in the reorganization process which determines the resulting cytoskeletal structures. Here we use an in vitro model system to show that myosin II actively reorganizes actin into a variety of mesoscopic patterns, but only in the presence of bundling proteins. We ﬁnd that the nature of the reorganization process is complex, exhibiting patterns and dynamical phenomena not predicted by current theoretical models and not observed in corresponding passive systems (excluding motors). This system generates active networks, asters and even rings depending on motor and bundling protein concentrations. Furthermore, the motors generate the formation of the patterns, but above a critical concentration they can also disassemble them and even totally prevent the polymerization and bundling of actin ﬁlaments. These results may suggest that tuning the assembly and disassembly of cytoskeletal structures can be obtained by tuning the local myosin II concentration/activity.},

  abstract = {A quantitative stochastic model of the mechanochemical cycle of myosin, the protein that drives muscle contraction, is proposed. It is based on three premises: (i) the myosin head incorporates a lever arm, whose equilibrium position adjusts as each of the products of ATP hydrolysis dissociates from the nucleotide pocket; (ii) the chemical reaction rates are modified according to the work done in moving the arm; and (iii) the compliance of myosin’s elastic element is designed to permit many molecules to work together efficiently. The model has a minimal number of parameters and provides an explanation, at the molecular level, of many of the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of steadily shortening muscle. In particular, the inf lexion in the force–velocity curve at a force approaching the isometric load is reproduced. Moreover, the model indicates that when large numbers of myosin molecules act collectively, their chemical cycles can be synchronized, and that this leads to stepwise motion of the thin filament. The oscillatory transient response of muscle to abrupt changes of load is interpreted in this light.},

  abstract = {Actin polymerization is typically initiated at speciﬁc sites in a cell by membrane-bound protein complexes, and the resulting structures are involved in specialized cellular functions, such as migration, particle uptake, or mitotic division. Here we analyze the potential of the actin system to self-organize into waves that propagate on the planar, substrate-attached membrane of a cell. We show that self-assembly involves the ordered recruitment of proteins from the cytoplasmic pool and relate the organization of actin waves to their capacity for applying force. Three proteins are shown to form distinct three-dimensional patterns in the actin waves. Myosin-IB is enriched at the wave front and close to the plasma membrane, the Arp2/3 complex is distributed throughout the waves, and coronin forms a sloping layer on top of them. CARMIL, a protein that links myosin-IB to the Arp2/3 complex, is also recruited to the waves. Wave formation does not depend on signals transmitted by heterotrimeric G-proteins, nor does their propagation require SCAR, a regulator upstream of the Arp2/3 complex. Propagation of the waves is based on an actin treadmilling mechanism, indicating a program that couples actin assembly to disassembly in a threedimensional pattern. When waves impinge on the cell perimeter, they push the edge forward; when they reverse direction, the cell border is paralyzed. These data show that force-generating, highly organized supramolecular networks are autonomously formed in live cells from molecular motors and proteins controlling actin polymerization and depolymerization.},

Alternative explanation of stiffening in cross-linked semiﬂexible networks. Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 178102]. These simulations make use of a geometrically nonlinear ﬁnite-element technique, taking into account the discreteness of the biopolymer network. As an alternative to the prevalent view, these computations relate the stiffening to nonafﬁne network reorientations. However, this discrete-network model neglects any interaction of the ﬁlaments with the surrounding ﬂuid, which is the origin of entropic stiffening in single ﬁlaments and in biopolymer networks, according to MacKintosh et al. For this reason, this article is devoted to a thorough study of the difference between both approaches on the 2D singleﬁlament level. In addition, we investigate the deviation from afﬁne deformation behavior, by comparing the discrete calculations with an afﬁne-network model.},

Using mean inextensibility, a simple analytical expression for the free energy for single filaments as a function of their end-to-end separation is obtained. This expression contains a term that explicitly represents the internal energy of the filament as well as nonzero temperature effects. Using this free energy, the force-extension relationships of semiflexible filaments and the corresponding nonlinear elasticity of their networks are investigated. Accounting for finite longitudinal compliance of filaments, we identify three distinct scaling regimes in the effective modulus of both single filaments and networks. We find the explicit expressions for crossovers between these scaling regimes; dramatic nonlinear elasticity will only be observed if there is a wide separation between the two crossovers.},

  abstract = {Actin filament (F-actin) is one of the dominant structural constituents in the cytoskeleton. Orchestrated by various actin binding proteins (ABPs), F-actin is assembled into higher-order structures such as bundles and networks that provide mechanical support for the cell and play important roles in numerous cellular processes. Although mechanical properties of F-actin networks have been extensively studied, the underlying mechanisms for network elasticity is not fully understood, in part because different measurements probe different length and force scales. Here, we developed both passive and active microrheology techniques using optical tweezers to estimate the mechanical properties of F-actin networks at a length scale comparable to cells. For the passive approach we tracked the motion of a thermally fluctuating colloidal sphere to estimate the frequencydependent complex shear modulus of the network. In the active approach, we used an optical trap to oscillate an embedded microsphere and monitored the response to obtain network viscoelasticity over a physiologically relevant force range. While both active and passive measurements exhibit similar results at low strain, the F-actin network subject to high strain exhibits non-linear behavior which is analogous to the strain-hardening observed in macroscale measurements. Using confocal and TIRF microscopy, we also characterize the microstructure of reconstituted F-actin networks in terms of filament length, mesh size, and degree of bundling. Finally, we propose a model of network connectivity by investigating the effect of filament length on the mechanical properties and structure.},

Intriguingly, the law characterizing the nonlinear response to stretch appears self-contradictory. Various cell types have been reported to both stiffen and soften, or ‘‘fluidize’’ upon stretch. Within the classical paradigm of cells as viscoelastic bodies, this constitutes a paradox.},

  abstract = {Many biomaterials formed by crosslinked semiflexible or rigid filaments exhibit non-linear rheology in the form of strain-stiffening and negative normal stress when samples are deformed in simple shear geometry. Two different classes of theoretical models have been developed to explain this non-linear elastic response, which is neither predicted by rubber elasticity theory nor observed in elastomers or gels formed by flexible polymers. One model considers the response of isotropic networks of semiflexible polymers that have non-linear force-elongation relations arising from their thermal fluctuations. The other considers networks of rigid filaments with linear forceelongation relations in which non-linearity arises from non-affine deformation and a shift from filament bending to stretching at increasing strains. Fibrin gels are a good experimental system to test these theories because the fibrin monomer assembles under different conditions to form either thermally fluctuating protofibrils with persistence length on the order of the network mesh size, or thicker rigid fibers. Comparison of rheologic and optical measurements shows that strain stiffening and negative normal stress appear at smaller strains than those at which filament orientation is evident from birefringence. Comparisons of shear to normal stresses and the straindependence of shear moduli and birefringence suggest methods to evaluate the applicability of different theories of rod-like polymer networks. The strain-dependence of the ratio of normal stress to shear stress is one parameter that distinguishes semi-flexible and rigid filament models, and comparisons with experiments reveal conditions under which specific theories may be applicable.},

  abstract = {The large amplitude oscillatory shear behavior of metallosupramolecular polymer networks formed by adding bis-Pd(II) crosslinkers to poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution is reported. The inﬂuence of scanning frequency, dissociation rate of cross-linkers, concentration of cross-linkers, and concentration of PVP solution on the large amplitude oscillatory shear behavior is explored. In semidilute unentangled PVP solutions, above a critical scanning frequency, strain hardening of both storage moduli and loss moduli is observed. In the semidilute entangled regime of PVP solution, however, strain softening is observed for samples with faster cross-linkers (kd ∼ 1450 sÀ1), whereas strain hardening is observed for samples with slower cross-linkers (kd ∼ 17 sÀ1). The mechanism of strain hardening is attributed primarily to a strain-induced increase in the number of elastically active chains, with possible contributions from non-Gaussian stretching of polymer chains at strains approaching network fracture. The divergent strain softening of samples with faster cross-linkers in semidilute entangled PVP solutions, relative to the strain hardening of samples with slower cross-linkers, is consistent with observed shear thinning/shear thickening behavior reported previously and is attributed to the fact that the average time that a cross-linker remains detached is too short to permit the local relaxation of polymer chain segments that is necessary for a net conversion of elastically inactive to elastically active cross-linkers. These and other observations paint a picture in which strain softening and shear thinning arise from the same set of molecular mechanisms, conceptually uniting the two nonlinear responses for this system.},

Each of these processes require precise regulation of cell shape and mechanical force generation which, to a large degree, is regulated by the dynamic mechanical behaviors of a diverse assortment of F-actin networks and bundles. In this review, we review the current understanding of the mechanics of F-actin networks and identify areas of further research needed to establish physical models. We ﬁrst review our understanding of the mechanical behaviors of F-actin networks reconstituted in vitro, with a focus on the nonlinear mechanical response and behavior of ‘‘active’’ F-actin networks. We then explore the types of mechanical response measured of cytoskeletal F-actin networks and bundles formed in living cells and identify how these measurements correspond to those performed on reconstituted F-actin networks formed in vitro. Together, these approaches identify the challenges and opportunities in the study of living cytoskeletal matter.},

Reversibility tests of shear modulus provide further evidence that strain softening of F-actin networks is caused by force-induced rupture of cross-links.},

In this study, we show that the macroscopic network response of reconstituted actin networks can be traced back to the microscopic interaction potential of an individual actin/ABP bond. The viscoelastic response of cross-linked actin networks is set by the cross-linker off-rate, the binding energy, and the characteristic bond length of individual actin/ABP interactions.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that semiflexible polymer chains (characterized by a persistence length l ) made up of discrete segments or bonds of length b show at large stretching forces a crossover from the standard wormlike chain (WLC) behavior to a discrete-chain (DC) behavior. In the DC regime, the stretching response is independent of the persistence length and shows a different force dependence than in the WLC regime. We perform extensive transfer-matrix calculations for the force-response of a freely rotating chain (FRC) model as a function of varying bond angle γ (and thus varying persistence length) and chain length. The FRC model is a first step toward the understanding of the stretching behavior of synthetic polymers, denatured proteins, and single-stranded DNA under large tensile forces. We also present scaling results for the force response of the elastically jointed chain (EJC) model, that is, a chain made up of freely jointed bonds that are connected by joints with some bending stiffness; this is the discretized version of the continuum WLC model. The EJC model might be applicable to stiff biopolymers such as double-stranded DNA or Actin. Both models show a similar crossover from the WLC to the DC behavior, which occurs at a force f/kBT ∼ l /b2 and is thus (for polymers with a moderately large persistence length) in the piconewton range probed in many AFM experiments. We also give a heuristic simple function for the force-distance relation of a FRC, valid in the global force range, which can be used to fit experimental data. Our findings might help to resolve the discrepancies encountered when trying to fit experimental data for the stretching response of polymers in a broad force range with a single effective persistence length.},

Under mechanical loading, cells exhibit creep and stress relaxation behavior that follows a power-law response rather than a classical exponential response. Such a response puts cells in the context of soft colloidal glasses and other disordered metastable materials that share the same properties. In cells, however, both the power-law exponent and stiffness are related to the contractile prestress in the cytoskeleton. In addition, cells are made of a highly nonlinear material that stiffens and ﬂuidizes under mechanical stress. They show active and adaptive mechanical behavior such as contraction and remodeling that sets them apart from any other nonliving material. Strikingly, all these observations can be linked by simple relationships with the power-law exponent as the only organizing parameter. Current theoretical models capture speciﬁc facets of cell mechanical behavior, but a comprehensive understanding is still emerging.},

  volume = {10},
  abstract = {With the success of in vitro single-molecule force measurements obtained in recent years, the next step is to perform quantitative force measurements inside a living cell. Optical traps have proven excellent tools for manipulation, also in vivo, where they can be essentially non-invasive under correct wavelength and exposure conditions. It is a pre-requisite for in vivo quantitative force measurements that a precise and reliable force calibration of the tweezers is performed. There are well-established calibration protocols in purely viscous environments; however, as the cellular cytoplasm is viscoelastic, it would be incorrect to use a calibration procedure relying on a viscous environment. Here we demonstrate a method to perform a correct force calibration inside a living cell. This method (theoretically proposed in Fischer and Berg-Sørensen (2007 J. Opt. A: Pure Appl. Opt. 9 S239)) takes into account the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm and relies on a combination of active and passive recordings of the motion of the cytoplasmic object of interest. The calibration procedure allows us to extract absolute values for the viscoelastic moduli of the living cell cytoplasm as well as the force constant describing the optical trap, thus paving the way for quantitative force measurements inside the living cell. Here, we determine both the spring constant of the optical trap and the elastic contribution from the cytoplasm, inﬂuencing the motion of naturally occurring tracer particles. The viscoelastic moduli that we ﬁnd are of the same order of magnitude as moduli found in other cell types by alternative methods.},

After presenting the basic conceptual fundamentals related to cell mechanobiology, we review the current state-of-the-art technologies that facilitate the understanding of mechanotransduction signaling pathways.

  abstract = {Differently from passive Brownian particles, active particles, also known as self-propelled Brownian particles or microswimmers and nanoswimmers, are capable of taking up energy from their environment and converting it into directed motion. Because of this constant flow of energy, their behavior can only be explained and understood within the framework of nonequilibrium physics. In the biological realm, many cells perform directed motion, for example, as a way to browse for nutrients or to avoid toxins. Inspired by these motile microorganisms, researchers have been developing artificial particles that feature similar swimming behaviors based on different mechanisms; these manmade micro- and nanomachines hold a great potential as autonomous agents for healthcare, sustainability, and security applications. With a focus on the basic physical features of the interactions of self-propelled Brownian particles with a crowded and complex environment, this comprehensive review will put the reader at the very forefront of the field, providing a guided tour through its basic principles, the development of artificial self-propelling micro- and nanoparticles, and their application to the study of nonequilibrium phenomena, as well as the open challenges that the field is currently facing.},

  abstract = {A semiﬂexible harmonic chain model with extensible bonds is introduced and applied to the stretching of semiﬂexible polymers or ﬁlaments. The semiﬂexible harmonic chain model allows to study eﬀects from bending rigidity, bond extension, discrete chain structure, and ﬁnite length of a semiﬂexible polymer in a uniﬁed manner. The interplay between bond extension and external force can be described by an eﬀective inextensible chain with increased stretching force, which leads to apparently reduced persistence lengths in force-extension relations. We obtain force-extension relations for strong- and weak-stretching regimes which include the eﬀects of extensible bonds, discrete chain structure, and ﬁnite polymer length. We discuss the associated characteristic force scales and calculate the crossover behaviour of the force-extension curves. Strong stretching is governed by the discrete chain structure and the bond extensibility. The linear response for weak stretching depends on the relative size of the contour length and the persistence length which aﬀects the behaviour of very rigid ﬁlaments such as F-actin. The results for the force-extension relations are corroborated by transfer matrix and variational calculations.},

In line with this, recent disease mutations in human IF proteins indicate that the nanomechanical properties of cell-type-specific IFs are central to the pathogenesis of diseases as diverse as muscular dystrophy and premature ageing. However, the analysis of these various diseases suggests that IFs also have an important role in cell-type-specific physiological functions.},

  abstract = {We present a study of the coarse-graining of polymers into bead-spring chains using statistical mechanics. The force–extension behavior is examined at different levels of coarse-graining. A direct result of the springs being decoupled is that the force–extension behavior depends only on the number of ﬂexibility lengths (e.g. persistence or Kuhn lengths) represented by each spring. This dimensionless parameter is found to govern the ﬂuctuations around the mean extension, analogous to the conventional role of temperature. The use of an effective ﬂexibility length to correct the model behavior is analyzed, and we have calculated bounds on the choices of this correction factor. The analytic nature of the statistical mechanical framework has also allowed for the calculation of asymptotic and universal behavior. The zero Weissenberg number rheological behavior is examined using the retarded-motion expansion coefﬁcients of bead-spring chains at different levels of coarse-graining. The results show the trade-off between using too few or too many springs. The general framework to analyze the force–extension and rheological behavior is applied to the worm-like chain, FENE, and Fraenkel models. We introduce a new method for coarse-graining a polymer into a bead-spring chain called the Polymer Ensemble Transformation (PET) method. Application to the freely jointed chain polymer yields a set of spring forcelaws called the Random Walk Spring (RWS) model. This new method illustrates why the previous spring force-laws cannot be used to ﬁnely discretize polymers and also provides new insight into how to rationally proceed in the coarse-graining of polymers into bead-spring chains. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The zeroshear viscosity shows a corresponding increase due to the intermolecular interactions of stiﬀer chains. We apply steady shear ﬂow to the polymer solutions and show that at high shear rates the ﬂow properties become almost independent of polymer stiﬀness. We characterize the polymer conformations under shear and ﬁnd that in this regime polymers are elongated and aligned along the ﬂow direction, but semiﬂexible polymers surprisingly form an increased number of hairpin-like conformations due to increased tumbling.},

The past decade has seen a resurgence of interest, with a variety of different micromechanical methods in current use that probe cells’ dynamic deformation in response to a time-varying force. The ability of researchers to carefully measure the mechanical properties of cells subjected to a variety of pharmacological and genetic interventions, however, currently outstrips our ability to quantitatively interpret the data in many cases.
